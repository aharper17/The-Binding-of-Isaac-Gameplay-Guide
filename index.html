      <br>
      <div class="logo"><img src="images/isaac_character.png" width="100" height="96" alt="" align="left"/></div>
      <h3>Isaac</h3>
		<p>Isaac is the titular character in The Binding of Isaac and The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, and the first available character in both. Issac's stats are simple, and he is considered the base of all characters.</p>
		<p>Isaac starts with no activated item, but after beating The Womb with Blue Baby, Isaac gains The Dice.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="logo"><img src="images/maggy_character.png" width="100" height="96" alt="" align="left"/></div>
        <h3>Magdalene</h3>
		<p>Magdalene, sometimes known as Maggy, is an unlockable character in The Binding of Isaac.</p>
		<p>She is unlocked by having seven heart containers of maximum health at any one time in a playthrough (Soul Hearts do not count, however, the temporary health boost from the XI Strength tarot card does.)</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="logo"><img src="images/cain_character.png" width="100" height="96" alt="" align="left"/></div>
        <h3>Cain</h3>
		<p>Cain is an unlockable character in The Binding of Isaac. He is unlocked by having a total of 55 coins at any one time in a playthrough (not just attaining 55 or more coins in a playthrough).</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="logo"><img src="images/judas_character.png" width="100" height="96" alt="" align="left"/></div>
      <h3>Judas</h3>
		<p>Judas is an unlockable character in The Binding of Isaac. He is unlocked by completing The Womb for the first time.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="logo"><img src="images/eve_character.png" width="100" height="96" alt="" align="left"/></div>
      <h3>Eve</h3>
		<p>Eve is the sixth unlockable character in The Binding of Isaac. She is unlocked by making two or more seals with the devil in one playthrough.</p>
        <p>When she is in the Whore of Babylon form, her attack is multiplied (x3) and a screen will appear saying, "What a horrible night to have a curse..."</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="logo"><img src="images/blue_baby_character.png" width="100" height="96" alt="" align="left"/></div>
      <h3>??? (Blue Baby)</h3>
		<p>???, also known as The Blue Baby, is an unlockable character in The Binding of Isaac. He is unlocked by completing the full game 10 times, after which Isaac will find him locked in a chest during the ending cutscene.</p>
        <p>Blue Baby is unique in that his health is made entirely of Soul Hearts and cannot be expanded with Heart Containers. This makes Soul Hearts the only source of replenishing health available to Blue Baby.</p>

        <br>
        <div class="logo"><img src="images/samson_character.png" width="100" height="96" alt="" align="left"/></div>

        <div class="logo"><img src="images/treasure_room_closed.png" width="100" height="96" alt="" align="left"/></div>
		<p>The Treasure Room (also known as the Item Room) is a room without Monsters that contains an Item on a pedestal. All items in the Treasure Room draw from the Treasure Room Item Pool. Therefore, items from other rooms (Devil Room, Challenge Room, Angel Room, etc.) cannot be found, unless they are in multiple pools.<br><br>It requires a key to access. An exception is The Basement 1/The Cellar 1, which does not. <br>The Basement/Cellar XL does require a key for both item rooms, however.</p>
        <br>
        <div class="logo"><img src="images/treasure_room_inside.jpg" width="200" height="100" alt="" align="left"/></div>

        <h3>Shop Rooms</h3>
        <br>

        <div class="logo"><img src="images/shop_door_closed.png" width="100" height="96" alt="" align="left"/></div>
		<p>In a Shop, players can buy between two and five Items from Greed, who is in a noose. There is a chance that any item in the store will be 50% off. This is indicated by the price being red. Prices are:<br><br>
        <li>3¢ for a regular heart. 2 at a discounted price.<br></li>
		<li>5¢ for any other pick up (bombs, keys, soul hearts, pills, and cards). 3 when the price is discounted.<br></li>
		<li>15¢ for an activated or collectible item. 7 when the item is discounted.<br><br></li>
The shop always requires a key to enter. If the Secret Room is adjacent to it, it can also be accessed by bombing the wall between them. The Hermit card will take the player straight to the shop. The Hermit card also opens the door so the player can exit if they do not possess a key.</p>
        <br>
        <div class="logo"><img src="images/shop_room_inside.jpg" width="200" height="100" alt="" align="left"/></div>

        <h3>Secret Rooms</h3>
        <br>
        <div class="logo"><img src="images/secret_room_door.png" width="100" height="96" alt="" align="left"/></div>
        <p>The Secret Room typically contains no enemies and 3-9 Coins (usually pennies, with slight chances for nickels and dimes), a slot machine, or an item. The "sin" mini-boss Greed will sometimes appear in a secret room instead - The Compass will show if he resides there (this is impossible in levels before The Depths or Necropolis, at which point all floors have a 50% chance of containing him inside).
<br><br>
In the Secret Room, the track Respite plays in the background.
<br><br>
Secret room can contain:
<br>
<li>3 random Coins</li>
<li>6 random Coins</li>
<li>9 random Coins</li>
<li>Slot Machine</li>
<li>Fortune Telling Machine</li>
<li>Greed or Super Greed</li></p>

        <h3>Boss Rooms</h3>
        <br>
        <div class="logo"><img src="images/boss_door.png" width="100" height="96" alt="" align="left"/></div>
		<p>The Boss Room is a room where the current floor's boss is fought, and the boss must be defeated in order to progress to the next floor (unless Isaac is teleported to the I AM ERROR room or uses the We Need To Go Deeper! item).
<br><br>
It is located on every floor, all the way up to Sheol and The Chest.
<br><br>
The room has a frame made out of bones and the room symbol and top of the door frame is a skull.
